					<p>Martin Greffe (1823–1879) was a French composer, mathematician, and theorist known for merging music and mathematics. Influenced by Mozart, he believed musical structure could reveal human consciousness. His compositions featured complex numerical patterns, foreshadowing twelve-tone techniques. His death in Mont Blanc remains mysterious, adding intrigue to his legacy.</p>

					<h2>Biography</h2>
					<p>Martin Greffe was a 19th-century French composer whose obsession with mathematics and eccentric personality made him both revered and feared in musical circles. His contemporaries often described him as a "mad genius" who treated musical composition like an unsolved mathematical theorem.</p>
					<p>While trained in classical music, Greffe became fascinated by the works of Mozart, particularly his ability to weave complex numerical patterns into his compositions. Greffe believed Mozart had unintentionally stumbled upon a secret mathematical formula within music—one that could reveal the very nature of human consciousness. This belief shaped his work and his friendships, particularly with early pioneers of the dodecaphony movement.</p>
					
					<h2>Musical Style & Influence</h2>
					<p>While Greffe composed during the Romantic era, his music was often radically different from his contemporaries. Influenced by Mozart’s structural genius, he sought to develop compositions dictated entirely by mathematical logic. Later in his life, he became connected with early thinkers who would eventually inspire the dodecaphonic movement. Some argue that Arnold Schoenberg himself referenced Greffe’s work when developing twelve-tone techniques.</p>
					<p>Greffe’s compositions were full of unpredictable tonal shifts, chaotic mathematical sequences, and recursive melodies. His refusal to follow traditional harmonic conventions led to heated debates among his peers. Some accused him of corrupting music with cold calculations, while others believed he was unlocking the hidden order of sound itself.</p>
					
					<h2>Famous Compositions</h2>
					<h3><a href="data/variations_arithmetiques.zip">Variations Arithmétiques (1851)</a></h3>
					<p>A mesmerizing study of arithmetic sequences in musical form. The audience is challenged to solve a musical riddle as the variations progress, making it a pioneering work in its genre.</p>
					<h3>Fugue en Nombres Premiers (1860)</h3>
					<p>A fugue constructed entirely from prime-numbered rhythmic cycles. Its unusual structure led some musicians to refer to it as “the labyrinth of sound.”</p>
					<h3>Fractales Sonores (1872)</h3>
					<p>Inspired by fractal geometry, this composition repeats motifs at different scales, creating an evolving, self-similar auditory experience.</p>
					<h3>Le Paradoxe de Greffe (1876)</h3>
					<p>A deeply unsettling work designed to create cognitive dissonance through paradoxical musical phrasing. Greffe himself claimed that “those who understand its logic will grasp the nature of existence.”</p>

					<h2>Mysterious Death</h2>
					<p>The circumstances surrounding Martin Greffe’s death remain one of music history’s great mysteries. Obsessed with solving the ultimate equation that would bridge music and mathematics, Greffe grew increasingly erratic in his final years. He retreated to Mont Blanc, convinced that isolation would grant him the clarity to complete his final theorem—a composition so mathematically perfect that it would transcend human perception.</p>
					<p>On October 4, 1879, he was found dead at the base of a cliff. Some claim he leapt to his death in despair, unable to complete his theorem. Others whisper of darker theories: a jealous rival, an angry debtor, or even his mistress’s enraged husband. The official record states his death was an accident, but for those who still analyze his works, the question remains—did Greffe’s final composition hold an answer we have yet to understand?</p>
